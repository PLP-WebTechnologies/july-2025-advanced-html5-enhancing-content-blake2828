# My Enhanced HTML5 Form – PLP Week 2 Project

This is my personal submission for the **PLP Web Technologies July 2025 Week 2** assignment. I created an enhanced HTML5 form that includes all required HTML5 features — forms, validation, media, tables, and lists — and made it reflect a bit of my personality too 😎.

## 🔍 What's Inside

### 📄 File Included:
- `enhanced-form.html` – a fully structured HTML5 form with rich content and media

---

## ✅ Features I Added

### 🔧 Semantic Layout
I used proper HTML5 semantic tags like:
- `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, and `<form>`
- Ensures clean structure and accessibility

### ✍️ Form Fields with Validation
I included a full form with:
- Required fields (`required`)
- Input types: `text`, `email`, `date`, `password`, `tel`, `url`
- Attributes like `placeholder`, `autocomplete`, `readonly`, and `pattern`
- File upload (`.pdf` only)

### 📋 Lists & Tables
- Unordered list showing benefits of signing up
- Simple pricing table with Free, Pro, and Enterprise tiers

### 🎵 Media That Represents Me
This was the fun part! I embedded songs I vibe with:
- 🎧 *Stereo Hearts* – Gym Class Heroes ft. Adam Levine
- 🎧 *IDGAF* – Dua Lipa
- 🎧 *Common Person* – Burna Boy
- Plus a sample video using the `<video>` tag

### 🧠 Personal Touch
- I added a referral code field that’s `readonly`
- Used personal tone in song sections and comments
- Kept the layout clean and responsive
